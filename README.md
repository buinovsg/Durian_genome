# Durian_genome

The aim of this project is to become familiar with genome assemmbly procedure by means of assembling a contig taken from a the raw read data taken from a Durio zibethinus assembly (https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3972). The project will include the following steps: read preprocessing, genome assembly, correction, quality check, annotation and differential expression analysis. Roughly the aim is to complete the steps up to correction by April 15th 2021 and to complete all analyses by May 4th 2021 followed by the result analysis and final presentation of results on May 26th 2021. The raw data and all analyses-related files will be stored in UPPMAX and organized in directories which indicate the order in which the analyses are to be performed.

The outline for the project, outline of steps and duscussion of results can be found on the Wiki page. The steps reference scripts found in the Code section.
